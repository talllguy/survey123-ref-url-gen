# Survey123 Referential URL Generator

A webform that generates a button for launching a Survey123 survey. [Try it here](https://talllguy.github.io/survey123-ref-url-gen/).

The purpose of the tool is to generate a URL or button for Esri ArcGIS web maps that carries forth a foreign key to Survey123 surveys. This process is important for maintaining referential integrity across features and related tables.

The tool is built with Bootstrap 4.
